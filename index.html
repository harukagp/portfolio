<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
Your website visitors want to know about you. Your “About Me” section is the place <br>
where you can brag about yourself. It is essential to make yourself stand out from the crowd.<br>
Be detailed yet concise in your “About Me” section. <br>
Visitors do not want to read an entire autobiography. <br>
Get to the point of your accomplishments and tell why they matter.<br>
It doesn’t hurt to put a picture in this section to help humanize your profile. <br>
 It used to be a picture is worth a thousand words, <br>
 now it’s more a video is worth a thousand words. Highly consider adding a video<br>
  introduction into your “About Me” section to help visitors get acquainted with you and your experience.<br>
Here are some good examples of designers who have utilized the “About Me” section correctly.<br>
</p> <br>

<h2>Career Sumamry </h2>
<ul>
<li>A professional portfolio showcasing your best work and demonstrating relevant skills can set you <br> 
    apart from other candidates in job applications across industries like art, design, publishing, and technology.</li>
<li>
    Key components of a portfolio include a career summary and personal introduction,<br>
    past experiences and qualifications, tangible achievements and awards, and a broad <br>
    spectrum of work examples highlighting different facets of your abilities.
</li>
<li>
    Regularly updating and personalising your portfolio to align with industry and <br>
    role-specific requirements, ensuring its aesthetic appeal, and maintaining clarity <br>
    through effective organization enhances its impact and creates <br>
    a powerful impression on potential employers.

<h2>Skills & Abilities</h2>
<p>Soft skills, or interpersonal skills, make up your personality and personal attributes.<br>
     They are always present but more difficult to prove, unlike hard skills, <br>
     which are quantifiable and teachable. Soft skills may not necessarily <br>
     make you qualified for more jobs. Still, they help you perform the job more <br>
     effectively and are valuable for team contribution and management.<br>
    Others may have the same required hard skills as you, so it’s critical to<br>
     draw attention to your soft skills and achievements on your resume as well. 
     This is what will help to set you apart from the competition</p>
